<h1>Go-to movies for an intellect stroke</h1>
<h2>MY personel top 3 films </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fantastic Mr fox </h3>
    <p>Yes it may be surprising but this Wes Anderson masterpiece is basically a cinema breaththrough in it of itself.<br>
     from the ironic sense of humor to the emotional climax,the movie is sheer perfection. <br>
     i mean, how could someone turn a children's book into such a philosophical and humorous story is beyond me ,and im not even mentioning the style here,
because i am pretty sure you have already heard about Wes's cinematic style by now</p>

<h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>
<p>Not listing a Quentin tarantino movie here would simply be a crime, for he is most probably my favorite film-maker of all time,nonetheless, this piece of art is what reminds me why i love cinema in the first place<br>
From the uneasy tension of the opening scene to the masterful chaos of the final act , i simply worship this movie , and i beleive everyone should too. </h4></p>
