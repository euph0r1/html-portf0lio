<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. 
  I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life. And more than that, I respect the strategy. 
  In your position, I would have done the same. One issue, which troubles me, I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends. 
  You know why I do this. 
  I want security for my family. 
</p>

<p>No speeches. Short speech. 
  You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. 
  The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. 
  Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. 
  I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up</p>

<p>I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. 
  You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. 
  So there's that. 
  How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive? </p>
